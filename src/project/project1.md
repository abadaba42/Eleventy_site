# Bus-number game

I'm not sure of the origin of this game, but i was taught it by my brother one day on the bus. Here (and i presume most places) the buses have a unique 4 digit id number. The game is as follows:

> Using all digits once, find a sequence of operations that result in ten^[I'm aware of variants that use other numbers like 24]

While not too difficult, it's a fun little ritual for riding public transport. But it raised an interesting question, what proportion of the 10,000 combinations are solvable? I'm not particularly good at algorithm design (or maths for that matter), so i figured this'd be a good little exercise to boost my skills.
