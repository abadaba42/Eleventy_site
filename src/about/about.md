# About
<br>
Hi, I'm Gus! I'm someone who gets distracted too easily. I'm mostly interested in trying to get better at everything from programming to writing and photography.


<br>Please enjoy my attempt at a little digital garden of sorts.

As a little disclaimer, I'm kind of an idiot who fucks things up regularly and is too self conscious to commit to my ideas.<br>
If you find something you think is bad, good, interesting or weird (or just want to say hi), please let me know at email@tbd.
