# About

Hi, I'm Gus! I'm a person interested in too many things for my own good.
Some of these things involve programming, writing and photography.


<br>Please enjoy my attempt at a little digital garden of sorts.

### Disclaimer
As a little disclaimer, I'm kind of an idiot who fucks things up regularly and is too self concious to commit to my ideas.<br>
If you find something you think is bad, good, interesting or outright weird (or just want to say hi), please let me know at email@tbd.
