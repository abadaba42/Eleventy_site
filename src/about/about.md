# About:

Hi i'm a goose, who's interested in a lot of stuff. 



<br>

Please enjoy my attempt at a little digital garden of sorts. 
This is meant to be a place that motivates me to make things. I love making things and understanding how things work, but i have a bad relationship with my self esteem.


This is meant to be a kind of digital garden; meandering, loose and generally a bit all over the place. 
It's all a work in progress and

(admittedly it's not meant to be a garden in the interconnected)



This is a static site generated with the help of [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). There is no Javascript here folks, 

i hope not to be too polished and precious about things.
